Use the basic.qos method with the prefetch_count=1 setting.
This tells RabbitMQ not to give more than one message to a worker at a time.
Or, in other words, don't dispatch a new message to a worker until it has processed and acknowledged the previous one.
Instead, it will dispatch it to the next worker that is not still busy.

"""
In order to make sure a message is never lost, RabbitMQ supports message acknowledgments.
An ack(nowledgement) is sent back from the consumer to tell RabbitMQ
that a particular message had been received, processed and that RabbitMQ is free to delete it.

If a consumer dies (its channel is closed, connection is closed, or TCP connection is lost) without sending an ack,
RabbitMQ will understand that a message wasn't processed fully and will re-queue it.
If there are other consumers online at the same time, it will then quickly redeliver it to another consumer.
That way you can be sure that no message is lost, even if the workers occasionally die.

There aren't any message timeouts; RabbitMQ will redeliver the message when the consumer dies.
It's fine even if processing a message takes a very, very long time.
