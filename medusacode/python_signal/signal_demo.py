signal â€” Set handlers for asynchronous events
"""
"""
signal.signal(signalnum, handler)
    Set the handler for signal signalnum to the function handler.
    handler can be a callable Python object taking two arguments (see below),
    or one of the special values signal.SIG_IGN or signal.SIG_DFL.
    The previous signal handler will be returned.

    When threads are enabled, this function can only be called from the main thread;
    attempting to call it from other threads will cause a ValueError exception to be raised.

    The handler is called with two arguments:
        the signal number
        the current stack frame (None or a frame object;

signal.pause()
    Cause the process to sleep until a signal is received;
    the appropriate handler will then be called.
    Returns nothing.


signal.getsignal(signalnum)
    Return the current signal handler for the signal signalnum.
    The returned value may be a callable Python object, or one of the special values:
        signal.SIG_IGN(1),
        signal.SIG_DFL(0),
        None.
    signal.SIG_IGN means that the signal was previously ignored,
    signal.SIG_DFL means that the default way of handling the signal was previously in use,
    None means that the previous signal handler was not installed from Python.
